# Grok-4 CLI Status Report

## Project Overview
This is a command-line interface (CLI) application for interacting with xAI's Grok-4 API. The app provides an interactive chat experience with various features including image generation, vision analysis, file operations, and conversation management.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Chat Mode**: Basic chat interface with Grok API integration
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token streaming with progress indicator
- **Multiple Model Support**: Switch between grok-4, grok-3, grok-3-mini, grok-2-image
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and configuration of xAI API keys
- **Chat History**: Save/load conversations with session management

#### Slash Commands Implemented
- `/help` - Display available commands
- `/model` - Switch between Grok models (with cancel option)
- `/clear` - Clear current conversation
- `/save` - Save conversation to file
- `/load` - Load previous conversation (with cancel option)
- `/history` - View conversation history
- `/search` - Configure Live Search mode (with cancel option)
- `/image <prompt>` - Generate images with Grok-2
- `/vision [image] [question]` - Analyze images with Grok-4 vision
- `/tools` - Toggle function calling for file operations
- `/config` - Configure settings (temperature, max tokens, stream mode, theme, API key)
- `/export` - Export conversation to multiple formats (MD, JSON, TXT, HTML)
- `/tokens` - Show token usage and cost tracking
- `/exit` - Exit the CLI

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Navigation**: Added "Cancel" and "Back" options to all interactive menus
- **Token Display**: Fixed formatting so responses appear on new lines
- **Cost Tracking**: Automatic calculation of API usage costs
- **Welcome Screen**: Animated ASCII art with loading indicators
- **Color Coding**: Consistent use of colors for different message types
- **Tab Completion**: Autocomplete for slash commands

#### File Operations (Function Calling)
- Read files from local filesystem
- Write/create files with AI assistance
- List directory contents
- Web search integration

### üî¥ Known Issues (Not Working)

1. **Chat Session Persistence** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - **Issue**: App exits immediately after receiving AI response
   - **Symptoms**: After Grok responds, the terminal returns to system prompt
   - **Root Cause**: Process exits with code 0 immediately after calling `promptUser()` to continue
   - **Debugging Added**:
     - Comprehensive debug logging system (`grok-debug.log`)
     - Process exit handlers to catch unexpected exits
     - Readline state tracking throughout execution
   - **Attempted Fixes (December 2024)**:
     - Changed from `rl.question()` callback to `rl.on('line')` event pattern
     - Added stdin.resume() after inquirer prompts
     - Added crlfDelay: Infinity to prevent auto-close
     - Added setImmediate() for prompt continuation
     - Added readline pause/resume checks
     - Added intentional close flag to prevent unexpected exits
     - Fixed unreachable code after process.exit()
   - **Debug Findings**:
     - Readline is NOT marked as closed when issue occurs
     - Process exits cleanly (code 0) with no errors
     - Happens after both slash commands and regular chat
     - Issue occurs AFTER enhancedChat completes successfully
     - Readline state shows as active but process still exits
   - **Status**: Still not resolved - mysterious clean exit after prompt

2. **Slash Command Palette**
   - **Issue**: Typing `/` alone doesn't show command palette as intended
   - **Expected**: Should display available commands in a table
   - **Current**: Only works with `/help` or tab completion
   - **Cause**: Removed keypress event handler due to readline conflicts

3. **Process Stability**
   - Unexpected exits without error messages
   - Possible memory or async handling issues
   - May be related to inquirer/readline interaction

## Potential Feature Upgrades

### High Priority
1. **Fix Chat Persistence** - Resolve the critical issue of app exiting after responses
2. **Bash Command Integration** - Add ability to execute system commands
   - `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` for navigation
   - `git` operations
   - File manipulation commands
   - Process management

3. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**
   - Integrate with Anthropic's MCP for enhanced tool use
   - Support for MCP servers
   - Dynamic tool discovery
   - Better file system operations
   - Database connections
   - API integrations

### Medium Priority

## Implementation TODOs

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Debug readline issue**: Investigate why the readline interface closes
   - Check for conflicts with inquirer prompts
   - Test with different Node.js versions
   - Consider alternative readline libraries (e.g., `readline-sync`, `prompt-sync`)

2. **Implement missing lib files**:
   - `lib/animations.js` - Loading animations and transitions
   - `lib/export.js` - Advanced export functionality
   - `lib/tools.js` - Tool execution helpers

3. **Add bash command execution**:
   ```javascript
   // Proposed implementation
   const { exec } = require('child_process');
   
   function executeBashCommand(command, callback) {
     exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
       if (error) {
         console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
         return;
       }
       callback(stdout);
     });
   }
   ```

4. **MCP Integration Planning**:
   - Research MCP protocol specification
   - Implement MCP client
   - Add MCP server discovery
   - Create tool adapters

## Debug Information

### Current Behavior Flow
1. User starts app ‚Üí Welcome screen displays ‚úÖ
2. Resume/new conversation prompt ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
3. User types message ‚Üí Sent to API ‚úÖ
4. API responds ‚Üí Displayed correctly ‚úÖ
5. enhancedChat completes ‚Üí Returns successfully ‚úÖ
6. promptUser() called ‚Üí Executes successfully ‚úÖ
7. rl.prompt() shows ‚Üí Prompt appears ‚úÖ
8. Process exits ‚Üí UNEXPECTED ‚ùå (clean exit, code 0)

### Debug Log Analysis (Latest)
```
[06:22:32.138Z] About to call promptUser() to continue chat loop, rl state: {}
[06:22:32.138Z] promptUser() called, rl state: {"terminal":true}
[06:22:32.139Z] rl.prompt() executed successfully
[06:22:32.139Z] promptUser() called to continue
[06:22:32.139Z] Process exiting with code: 0
```
- Readline state is empty `{}` but terminal is true
- No close event is triggered
- No error is thrown
- Process exits cleanly immediately after prompt

### Code Changes Made
1. **Readline Event Pattern**: Changed from callback-based `rl.question()` to event-based `rl.on('line')`
2. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to `grok-debug.log`
3. **Stdin Management**: Added `stdin.resume()` after inquirer prompts
4. **Readline Options**: Added `crlfDelay: Infinity` to prevent auto-close
5. **Async Handling**: Used `setImmediate()` for prompt continuation
6. **State Checks**: Added readline pause/resume checks
7. **Exit Prevention**: Added intentional close flag system

### Suspected Root Causes (Still Investigating)
- Node.js event loop issue with async handlers
- Hidden readline timeout or limit
- Interaction between inquirer and readline libraries
- Stream buffer issue after direct stdout writes
- Possible Node.js version-specific bug

### Next Debugging Steps
1. Try using `process.nextTick()` instead of `setImmediate()`
2. Test with readline-sync as alternative
3. Add keep-alive mechanism to prevent exit
4. Check for hidden event listeners
5. Test on different Node.js versions
6. Consider switching to different input library

## Notes for Future Development

### Design Decisions
- Using OpenAI client library for xAI API (compatible)
- Chose readline over alternatives for better control
- Streaming mode as default for better UX
- Local file storage for configuration and history

### Known Limitations
- No multi-user support
- Single conversation thread at a time
- Limited to text and image inputs (no audio/video)
- Requires API key (no local model support)

### Testing Needed
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, Linux)
- Network error handling
- Large file handling
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory usage with long conversations
